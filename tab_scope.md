## Scope and Definitions

### Scope
The aim was to create a listing of vendor-neutral and technology agnostic terms that describe real-world automated threats to web applications, at a level of abstraction that application owners can relate to. These terms are threat events to web applications undertaken using automated actions.

The focus is on abuse of functionality - misuse of inherent functionality and related design flaws, some of which are also referred to as business logic flaws. There is almost no focus on implementation bugs. It is not that the latter are not the target for attacks, but there is much more knowledge published in that area with a greater agreement on terminology. All the scenarios identified must require the web to exist for the threat to be materialised. Many of the scenarios have impacts upon the organisation that owns or operates web applications, but some scenarios have impacts more focused on individuals or other bodies. An attack that can be achieved without the web is out of scope.

### Definitions

#### Automated Threats to Web Applications
Threat events to web applications undertaken using automated actions. 

An attack that can be achieved without the web is out of scope.

### Glossary

#### Action
An act taken against an asset by a threat agent. Requires first that contact occurs between the asset and threat agent (Ref 1)

#### Application
Software that performs a business process i.e. not system software

A software program hosted by an information system (Ref 2)
#### Application layer
"Layer 7” in the OSI model (Ref 3) and “application layer” in the TCP/IP model (Ref 4)

#### Threat
Anything that is capable of acting in a manner resulting in harm to an asset and/or organization; for example, acts of God (weather, geological events, etc.); malicious actors; errors; failures (Ref 1)

#### Threat Agent
Any agent (e.g., object, substance, human, etc.) that is capable of acting against an asset in a manner that can result in harm (Ref 1)

#### Threat Event
Occurs when a threat agent acts against an asset (Ref 1)

#### Web
The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) (Ref 5)

The first three specifications for Web technologies defined URLs, HTTP, and HTML (Ref 6)

#### Web application
An application delivered over the web
